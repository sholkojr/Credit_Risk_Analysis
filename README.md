# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the factors that affect the risk levels associated with individuals who may apply for loans based on their credit status and history.  This analysis utilised various supervised machine learning models to attempt to accurately predict whether or not individuals were "high" or "low" credit risk.  Due to the heavy imbalance of the data (far more low risk individuals vs. high risk), several techniques were implemented to improve model accuracy, including:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (or SMOTE)
- Undersampling using the Cluster Centriods algorithm
- Combination (Over and Under) Sampling using SMOTEEN
- Ensemble Classifier Decision Tree method using the Balanced Random Forest Algorithm
- Adaptive Boost (AdaBoost) Classifier

## Results

Each of the methods produced distict results as follows:
